## Detecting chromosomal segment deletions and aneuploidy in wheat

This is the code repository accompanying "In-silico detection of aneuploidy and chromosomal deletions in wheat using genotyping-by-sequencing" manuscript.

After running the shell script in `shell_script_to_generate_hapfile` directory, you will get a hapfile that can be read into and analyzed in `R` using `main_script.R`. This `R` script produced all the figures and karyotypes in the paper.
